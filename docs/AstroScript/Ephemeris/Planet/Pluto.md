# NAME

AstroScript::Ephemeris::Planet::Pluto

# SYNOPSIS

    use AstroScript::Ephemeris::Planet::Pluto;
    my $planet = AstroScript::Ephemeris::Planet::Pluto->new();
    my $geo = $planet->position($t); #  apparent geocentric ecliptical coordinates

# DESCRIPTION

Child class of [AstroScript::Ephemeris::Planet](https:/github.com/skrushinsky/astroscript/docs/AstroScript/Ephemeris/Planet.md), responsible for calculating
**Pluto** position.

The coordinates are first calculated relative to the fixed ecliptic of 1950, and
then transformed to the equinox of date. This method is nesessary because of
the high inclination of Pluto's orbit.

# CAVEATS

The routine is applicable only between years **1890** and **2100**.

    The reason for this is that the series expansion used was not derived from
    perturbation theory, but from a Fourier analysis of a numerically integrated
    ephemeris covering this period of time. Even a few years before 1890 or after
    2100, the errors in the calculated coordinates grow very sharply, reaqching
    values of more than 0.5 arc-degrees.
